The idea with, and reasons for why to use, a ORM-mapper -> ORM provides a layer of abstraction that simplifies working with database data in an object-oriented manner. Instead of writing SQL Queries, ORM provides a way to perform operations on the database using method calls. It is easier, faster and maintailable.
The meaning of the terms JPA, Hibernate and Spring Data JPA and how they are connected -> JPA is a specification that defines a set of interfaces and annotations for ORM in Java applications. It provides a standard way to map Java objects to relational database tables. -> Hibernate is an ORM framework that implements the JPA specification. It provides a set of features for mapping Java object to database tables and performing database operations on these. -> Spring Data JPA is a part of the Spring Framework. It builds on top of JPA and Hibernate, with a higher-level abstraction to work with databases. It offers a repository abstraction that automatically generates repository implementations for JPA entities.
How to create simple Java entities and map them to a database via the Spring Data API -> This is done with the @Entity annotation, which specifies that the class is an entity that are to be mapped with a database table.
How to control the mapping between individual fields in an Entity class and their matching columns in the database -> We use annotations to map an entity class to a table in the database. The @Entity annotation indicates that the class is an entity and should be mapped to a table in the database. The @Table annotation specifies the name of the database table to which the entity is mapped. The @Colum annotation, maps a field to a specific column in the database table. Here we can specify the column's name, length, nullable and much more.
How to auto generate IDs, and how to ensure we are using a specific database's preferred way of doing it (Auto Increment in our case for MySQL) -> To auto generate IDs, we use the @GeneratedValue annotation. To ensure we are using the MySQL database's preffered way of auto increment we set the strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY.
How to use and define repositories and relevant query methods using Spring Data JPAs repository pattern -> You start by defining a JPA entity class that represents the database table with @Entity. Then you create an interface that extends the JpaRepository<Entity class, type of primary key>. You can then define custom query methods in the repository interface. The methods are derived from the method name and can include specific keywords to indicate the action and the fields involved.
How to write simple "integration" tests, using H2 as a mock-database instead of MySQL -> To write a simple "integration" test using H2, you create a new test.java class and use the @DataJPATest annotation. We create a method setUp with the @BeforeEach annotation where we set up the test data for the H2. We also have to inject the repository we are testing and do this with the @Autowired annotation. We can then write different test, and because it rolls back before each test - the test data is the same for each test.
How to add (dev) connection details for you local MySQL database -> You set a 'placeholder' variable in the application.properties of the project and set the variable values in the environment variables of the project. That way the sensitive data is hidden.
